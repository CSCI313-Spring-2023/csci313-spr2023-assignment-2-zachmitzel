        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="bio">My name is Zachary Mitzel. I was born and raised in Fargo, ND. I went to Fargo Davies HS where I competed in football, baksetball, and track and field for all 4 years. 
        Following graduation, I was accepted into NDSU as a computer engineering major. A few weeks into my first semester I realized that my future would lie in the computer science field rather than engineering, so I switched. Luckily, I was able 
    to switch with very little complications. I am currently a second-year student but I had enough credits transfer from high school where I'm considered a junior. I'm currently in the process of starting the 4+1 masters program for CS at NDSU. I hope to recieve my bachelors
 in the spring of 2024 and my masters in the spring of 2025. I participate in many of the intramural sports at NDSU, such as flag football, basketball, and volleyball. As of January 2023, I am in an 8-month co-op position at Doosan Bobcat as a marketing data analyst.
 I hope to be able to pursue a career in software engineering following my graduation from NDSU.</p>
